# **Message In A Bottle**

## **Overview**
"Message In A Bottle" is a Flask-based web application that allows users to create personalised playlists on Spotify. Each song represents a word from a hidden message, with each word in the message being the first word of each song. Users can customise their playlist's mood, energy, and danceability using interactive sliders.
